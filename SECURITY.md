## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

### 2. Report privately via:
- **Email**: security@studentplatform.com
- **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use the "Security" tab in our repository

### 3. Include in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if you have one)
- Your contact information

### 4. What to expect:
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Regular updates**: Every 7 days until resolved
- **Resolution timeline**: Typically 30-90 days depending on complexity

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens with secure expiration
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Session management with refresh tokens
- Multi-factor authentication support

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints

### Infrastructure Security
- HTTPS enforcement
- Secure headers configuration
- Environment variable protection
- Database connection security
- File upload restrictions
- Content Security Policy (CSP)

### Privacy & Compliance
- GDPR compliance measures
- Data retention policies
- User consent management
- Audit logging
- Data anonymization options

## 🔍 Security Best Practices

### For Developers
```bash
# Never commit secrets
git-secrets --install
git-secrets --register-aws

# Use environment variables
export JWT_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"

# Validate all inputs
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

# Use parameterized queries
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))
```

### For Deployment
```bash
# Use strong passwords
openssl rand -base64 32

# Enable firewall
ufw enable
ufw allow 22
ufw allow 80
ufw allow 443

# Regular updates
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

### For Users
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Keep browsers updated
- Report suspicious activity
- Log out from shared devices

## 🚫 Security Don'ts

### Never Do:
- Commit API keys or secrets to version control
- Use default passwords in production
- Disable SSL/TLS verification
- Trust user input without validation
- Store passwords in plain text
- Use outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities
- Expose debug information in production
- Use weak encryption algorithms

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Strong JWT secret (minimum 32 characters)
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-jwt-key-min-32-chars

# Secure database connection
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db?sslmode=require

# API rate limiting
RATE_LIMIT_CHAT=10/minute
RATE_LIMIT_OCR=5/minute
RATE_LIMIT_UPLOAD=20/minute
```

### Security Headers
```python
# FastAPI security headers
from fastapi.middleware.trustedhost import TrustedHostMiddleware
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    TrustedHostMiddleware,
    allowed_hosts=["yourdomain.com", "*.yourdomain.com"]
)

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["https://yourdomain.com"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

## 🔍 Security Auditing

### Regular Security Checks
```bash
# Dependency vulnerability scanning
npm audit
pip-audit

# Code security analysis
bandit -r backend/
semgrep --config=auto frontend/

# Container security scanning
trivy image your-image:latest
```

### Automated Security Testing
- **SAST** (Static Application Security Testing)
- **DAST** (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
- **Dependency scanning**
- **Container scanning**
- **Infrastructure as Code scanning**

## 🚨 Incident Response

### In Case of Security Incident:

1. **Immediate Response** (0-1 hour):
   - Assess the scope and impact
   - Contain the incident
   - Preserve evidence
   - Notify security team

2. **Short-term Response** (1-24 hours):
   - Implement temporary fixes
   - Communicate with stakeholders
   - Document the incident
   - Begin forensic analysis

3. **Long-term Response** (1-7 days):
   - Implement permanent fixes
   - Update security measures
   - Conduct post-incident review
   - Update documentation
